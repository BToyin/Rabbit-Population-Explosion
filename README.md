# Rabbit-Population-Explosion

## Sprint 0

### Pre-Planning (Monday, 26.10. 10:00-13:00)
- received product requirements from the client (Manish)
- created a GitHub repo and a project board in order to track work
- creating user stories with acceptance criteria and testing plan based on customer requirements
  - As a user, I would like to see how many male and female rabbits there are, so that I can see how the population is split.
  - As a user, I would like to see the time passed, so I can see how the data changed by time.
  - As a User, I would like to give a time span, so that I can choose how long the program runs.
  - As a User, I would like the program to start with 1 male and 1 female rabbit, so that it models a group of rabbits accurately.
  - As a user, I would like to see the final population, so that I can analyse the data.
  - As a user, I would like to see the death count, so that I would know how many rabbits died.
- created definitions of done for both user stories and project as a whole
- created an outline of a project
- came up with the questions to be clarified by the client

### Planning (Monday, 26.10. 14:00-15:30)
- questions clarified by the client 
- created coding convention
- additional user stories added
  - As a user, I would like to know where to input any information, so that I know how to navigate the program.
  - As a user, I would like to know what I need to enter for the program to run, so that I know what Is considered a valid input
  - As a user, I would like to know how the data will be displayed so that I know where to look for this information
